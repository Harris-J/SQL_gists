# SQL_gists

I started this because I thought I could somehow connect a bunch of sql snippets that all related to the Horizon ILS. 
I realize there is a repository on the support site, but this was my way of doing iterations on single calls. Perhaps there is a way to connect the Github Gists into a repoistory but I think I may just use Github to store these things.
