# SQL_gists

I started this because I thought I could somehow connect a bunch of sql snippets that all related to Sirsidynix  Horizon ILS. 
I realize there is a repository on the support site, but this was my way of doing iterations on single calls. 

Perhaps there is a way to connect the Github Gists into a repoistory but I think I may just use Github to store these things. 

### Other perhaps better places for help
- The best place to get help with Sirsidynix Horizon is the [support site](https://support.sirsidynix.com/ "sirsidynix support site")
-  - The [dev page has several scripts](https://support.sirsidynix.com/dev)
